        <h1>Help</h1>
        <h2>&#9679; Installation</h2>
        <p>To Install MaineCoon head on over to the <a href="download.html">Download</a> Page and download the<br> appropriate package for your computer. Next run the installer,<br> this is pretty straightforward and <br><br>No errors should occurr during this.<br>
        If errors come about make sure to tell me about it<br> by <a href="contact.html">contacting</a> me.<br><br> After you run the<br>installer you should be greeted<br> with a wizard to install, simply hit <br>install and wait for MaineCoon to install<br><br> You can go grab a cup of coffee during this or go show affection to your faviorite feline. <br><br> After it says "Installation Finished" MaineCoon Will be setup, you will find a shortcut<br>on your desktop or you can search for it in the windows<br>menu by pressing the windows key and searching. </p>
        <h2>&#9679; General Usage</h2>
        <p>So one you've gotten it installed and launched you should<br> be greeted with herbert the mainecoon and a nice<br> user interface for MaineCoon. <br><br> Running it immediatly is pretty easy all you have to do<br> is input the number of parts you want to create be careful<br>as trying to create to many parts will more than<br>likely crash your game before it crashes<br> the server . I would not advise more than 500K parts<br> and about 100K ish scripts will work on most medium server<br>but use it how you want. And after that you need to attach it to <br>roblox by hitting attach, then you can just go and<br>execute it by hitting execute.<br><br>Now if you want to be more efficient and effective, you might want to use<br>some other options, Humanoid Parts and Nest Parts, <br>are a great way of doing this to big servers<br> though this will be more cpu intensive for you<br>
        so make sure you have enough machine for Mainecoon<br>And the other options do exactly as they say so.<br><br>Each server is going to be a bit different to crash than other so<br>you will need to tweak you settings.<br> <br>You can also save your current setting to a file by hitting <br>the "save" button.</p><br>
