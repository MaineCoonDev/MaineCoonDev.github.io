        <h2>&#9679; Downloading</h2>
        <p>To Get MaineCoon head on over to the <a href="download.html">Download</a> Page and download the<br> appropriate version for your computer. Next run Mainecoone, and wallah you now<br>can use Mainecoon on any server you want! 
        <h2>&#9679; General Usage</h2>
        <p>So one you've gotten it downloaded and launched you should<br> be greeted with the Mainecoon GUI, if not then your OS is probably not supported and you will sadly have to wait till it is released on your platform.<br> Doing the rest is pretty easy first press "Attach" to inject Mainecoon into minecraft.<br>Then you can use any of the available hacks included with mainecoons gui<br> on pretty much any server without being detected<br> and it's that simple, remember to submit any hack requests you'd like to see added to the client, to me!
