        <h2>&#9679; Downloading</h2>
        <p>To Get MaineCoon head on over to the <a href="download.html">Download</a> Page and download the<br> appropriate version for your computer. Next run Mainecoone, and wallah you now<br>can use Mainecoon for any script execution you want! 
        <h2>&#9679; General Usage</h2>
        <p>So one you've gotten it downloaded and launched you should<br> be greeted with the Mainecoon GUI, if not then your OS is probably not supported and you will sadly have to wait till it is released on your platform.<br> Doing the rest is pretty easy first press "Attach" to inject Mainecoon into roblox.<br>To load a script simply hit "Open File" and navigate<br> to your script and select it, you can also paste your script into the script box in the GUI<br> after that you simply hit execute and your script should now be executed into your current session of roblox. <br> And it's that easy and you are ready to go!
