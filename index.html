        <h1>MaineCoon Level 7 Executor.</h1>
        <p>Mainecoon is a powerful Lua Script Executor that is soon to be<br>open source. It is fast, reliable and borderline unpatchable.</p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>MaineCoon works by quitely injecting itself into roblox<br>and disguising itself as a part of roblox. Mainecoon also is able to execute high level scripts with simple backend payloads to preform not only<br>local changes to scripts but server wide changes. Mainecoon is currently in it's alpha stages so bugs are expected<br>so please make sure to make us aware of it!</p>
        <h2>Is it free?</h2>
        <p>Yes! it is 100% free, all costs come out of either my own pocket or donations.<br>Which you can donate <a href="donations.html">Here</a> if you would like to help out with the project</p>
        <h2>Where can I get it?</h2>
        <p>You can obtain  MaineCoon by going over to the <a href="download.html">Download</a> Page or by going to the <a href="https://mega.nz/file/8A4hnASZ#28i9up6i57fGC7mQOl79dUfjQdX-NTCGGT_CQAebCeo">Mega</a> Mirror.</p>
