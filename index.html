        <h1>MaineCoon Server Crasher.</h1>
        <p>Mainecoon Server crasher is a powerful roblox server crasher that is soon to be<br>open source. It is fast, reliable and borderline unpatchable.</p>
        <h2>How does it work?</h2>
        <p>MaineCoon works by heaps and heaps of objects and bloat scripts<br>and injecting them into pre-existing server objects, so much so that at first this will<br>cause mild to extreme server lag. After a while the server will no longer be able to keep up<br>with the amount of scripts objects and requests that the server just sort of falls in on it's self.</p>
        <h2>Is it free?</h2>
        <p>Yes! it is 100% free, all costs come out of either my own pocket or donations.<br>Which you can donate <a href="">Here</a> if you would like to help out with the project</p>
        <h2>Where can I get it?</h2>
        <p>You can obtain  MaineCoon by going over to the <a href="download.html">Download</a> Page or by going to the <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> Repo.</p>
